# Mood_recognition
You guys can view my work here for convenient: https://nbviewer.org/github/Vinhkewl/Mood_Detection/blob/main/Mood%20Detection-checkpoint.ipynb#1
Im using Pytorch and YOLOv5 for face recognition and detect mood including 6 steps:
## 1. Install and Import Dependencies
## 2. Load model
## 3. Make Detections
## 4. Real time detection
## 5. Train from scratch
## 6. Load Model

i adopt this framework from Nicholas Renotte and adjust a little bit for my own environment
